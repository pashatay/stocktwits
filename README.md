# Stock Twits

Stock Twits App will display the latest twits mentioning selected stock.
The application is fully responsive.Twits get displayed as you type, supporting instant search functionality.
New twits get uploaded automatically without a need to refresh the page.

I used [StockTwits API](https://api.stocktwits.com/developers/docs) to build this app along with the following technologies:

- React (Context, Hooks),
- Node/Express,
- CSS, Bootstrap, HTML.
